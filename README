This is a freemind patterns.xml file implementing my personal TODO
and project management process.

See mindmaps in the doc directory for the process I use with this
freemind configuration.

To use this on Windows, go to...

c:\Documents and Settings\%USER%\.freemind

and do a 

   git clone git://github.com/dmsasser/freemind-config.git .

On linux this would be

   cd ~/.freemind
   git clone git://github.com/dmsasser/freemind-config.git .

WARNING:  if you already have a local patterns.xml (and you likely do), this 
will fail unless you do some other magic.  Magic could including removing 
your local files or something else (I usually just use rsync to move things).
